# Hello World

This is a test blog post for the Next.js site.

## Code Examples

Here's some JavaScript code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

And some TypeScript:

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30
};
```

And a bash command:

```bash
npm install next react react-dom
```

```python
def welp(hello: str): -> None
    pass
```
