In Mayâ€™s Federated Analytics webinar I shared the story of Bunny and our open-source tools built to make federation easier in practice.

Bunny lets trusted research environments answer cohort discovery queries against OMOP datasets quickly and securely, returning only aggregate results with built-in disclosure controls. Relay builds on this by linking multiple Bunny's into resilient networks, making it simpler for organisations to collaborate at scale.

Adoption has been rapid, with most NHS Secure Data Environments now deploying Bunny and several partners already contributing code.
