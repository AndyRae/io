At the 2024 Taiwan International Biobanks Conference I gave a keynote in the session on International Trends and Best Practices in the Governance of Genomic and Health Data.

My talk focused on secure data sharing environments and federated models of governance, exploring how these approaches can protect sensitive health and genomic data while still enabling research and innovation.

I spoke about the importance of designing infrastructures that build trust, reduce risk, and make collaboration possible across borders, so that the benefits of precision medicine and biobank data can be realised for patients and the public.

While in Taipei I also met with the Ministry of Health and Welfare on genomic and health data governance, and met with the Taiwan Biobank team.
